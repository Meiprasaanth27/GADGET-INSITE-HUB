                <p>The Canon EOS R6 Mark II is our favorite full-frame camera for most people. It snaps attractive 24MP photos and has a class-leading autofocus system that smartly recognizes people, animals, and vehicles. With 12fps (mechanical) and 40fps (electronic shutter) bursts available, it's especially suitable for action shots, while stabilized 4K60 video should please filmmakers and vloggers.</p>

        <h3><u>Samsung 65-Inch S90C OLED TV</u></h3>
            <div class="boxcont2">
            <div>
                <p>Rating: &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</p>
                <p class="p2">OLED TVs are much more expensive than LED TVs, but their slim panels and incredible pictures often justify the premium price. Samsung’s flagship S95C OLED ($3,299.99 for the 65-inch model) earned our Editors’ Choice award earlier this year for its top-notch performance. The company’s step-down model, the S90C, is almost as impressive and much less expensive at $2,599.99 for 65 inches. It isn’t quite as bright as the S95C, but that just means it’s the second-brightest OLED TV we’ve ever seen; its color range and accuracy are every bit as incredible. It is also the fastest TV we’ve measured in terms of input lag, making it a potential top choice for gamers. As such, the Samsung S90C earns our Editors’ Choice award for OLED TVs.</p>
                <p>From the front, the S90C looks like any other mid-to-high-end modern TV. A thin band runs along the top edge and sides while a slightly thicker metallic strip crosses the bottom edge. A small rectangular bump with a tiny Samsung logo sits on the lower right edge of the screen. It’s an elegant look that keeps your focus locked onto the screen rather than showy design flourishes. The stand is similarly simple and stylish; a gray metal square holds the screen up via two metal legs.

        <h3><u>Amazon Echo (4th Gen)</u></h3>
        <div style="float: left; margin-right: 20px;">

                <p>The original Amazon Echo started the smart speaker trend and has only improved over time. The current iteration of the Echo is sphere-shaped rather than cylindrical. It features a built-in temperature sensor and a Zigbee smart home hub for compatible devices, and gets surprisingly loud for its size. It's effectively as powerful as the now-discontinued Amazon Echo Plus, which served as the scaled-up Echo speaker until the Echo Studio solidly assumed that role. That means strong bass in a fairly compact package.</p>
                <p>We rate the Echo more highly than its Google Assistant counterpart, the Google Nest Audio, because of that stronger bass response and room-filling sound. The temperature sensor is a nice gimmick and the Zigbee hub can be helpful if you have older Zigbee smart home devices, but both Alexa and Google Assistant now have fairly extensive built-in support for home automations. It's the sound that puts the Echo over the top.<a href="#">Read More</a></p></p>

            <h3><u>Jabra Elite 10</u></h3>
            <div class="boxcont2">
            <div>
                <p>Rating: &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;</p>
                <p class="p2">Jabra's Elite 10 earphones offer top-tier ANC for the price, an excellent app with EQ and ANC controls, and top-notch mics. Additionally, we're fans of their bass-forward sound signature. All that would be enough to secure the Jabras a spot on our list, but they also sport an IP57 rating, meaning they are well-sealed against dust and fully waterproof. Most competing ANC models are merely somewhat water-resistant. As such, we can overlook the lack of high-quality Bluetooth codecs for Android users.</p>
                <p>The Elite 10 are a great combination of solid ANC, fine sound reproduction, and protection from the elements, making them a great option for runners and other fitness folks who want high-quality performance when in the zone.
