                <p>Ultrabooks are the best laptops for most people, including college students, writers, office workers, and commuters. They have great keyboards, screens, and battery life; they offer enough power to do everything most people need a computer for; and they’re thin, light, and portable. You should expect to pay between $900 and $1,300 for a great Windows ultrabook that will last you at least four years.</p>
                <p>The HP Spectre x360 13.5″ has the best combination of what makes an ultrabook great: It offers fast performance, all-day battery life, a tall and spacious screen, a quality keyboard and trackpad, and an excellent webcam. The Spectre x360 also has a 360-degree hinge that lets you flip the touchscreen all the way around, and some models come with an active stylus. Our pick isn’t as light or compact as some other Windows ultrabooks—though at 3 pounds it’s certainly not heavy, either. And it ships with too much bloatware, all of which you should uninstall when the laptop arrives.<a href="#">Read More</a></p></p>

        <h3><u>Apple MacBook Air (M2, 2022, 13″)</u></h3>

                <p class="p2">If you prefer macOS or need great tech support, a MacBook is a safe bet; the 13-inch models usually offer the best combination of size, weight, and speed. They’re great for writers, office workers, commuters, and college students. Apple’s newest MacBooks also include new Apple-designed processors that help them run cooler and quieter than most laptops and give them exceptionally good battery life. Expect to pay at least $1,000 for one with good enough specs and storage to last you at least four years.</p>
                <p>The 13-inch M2 MacBook Air delivers strong performance and fantastic battery life at a reasonable price. And the Air’s keyboard is actually good, since Apple traded out the shallow and failure-prone butterfly switches under the keys of 2018- and 2019-era MacBook Airs for springier and more satisfying scissor switches. Like Apple’s other laptops, the Air has only a few ports (in this case, two Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports, which may require you to use a hub or new cables). But the Air’s light weight, solid construction, and industry-leading support make it a great laptop, especially if you also own an iPhone or other Apple devices.

                <p>Most Windows computers priced around $500 or less are large and heavy and saddled with poor battery life—among other flaws—but a bit more money can buy you an ultrabook that’s almost as good as much more expensive options. Budget ultrabooks are ideal for students as well as for anyone who can spend around $800 on a laptop.</p>

            <h3><u>Acer Aspire 3 Spin 14 (A3SP14-31PT)</u></h3>

                <p class="p2">If you need a Windows laptop for home, work, or school—and you can’t afford to spend a lot—you can find a decent one for less than $500. These computers are ideal for grade-school and middle-school students, people on a strict budget, and those who use their computers mostly at home in the evenings for doing schoolwork, browsing the web, managing a budget, or watching Netflix. Cheaper, lighter laptops tend to be too slow for everyday tasks, while faster, sleeker ones usually cost too much.</p>
                <p>The Acer Aspire 3 Spin 14 (A3SP14-31PT) in any of our recommended configurations—37NV, 38YA, or 32M6—is fast enough to meet most people’s computing needs. Plus, it has a tall, 14-inch 1920×1200 touchscreen and a 360-degree hinge, and its keyboard and trackpad are accurate and reliable. The Aspire 3 Spin 14 is also more compact and offers better battery life than most bulky Windows laptops in this price range.
